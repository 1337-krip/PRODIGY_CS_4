# Basic Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger program written in Python that records and logs keystrokes. It logs the keys pressed and saves them to a file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the `pynput` library using pip:

    ```sh
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Usage

1. Save the keylogger script to a file, e.g., `keylogger.py`.

2. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python keylogger.py
    ```

3. The keylogger will start recording keystrokes and save them to `key_log.txt` in the same directory.

4. To stop the keylogger, press the `ESC` key.
